# 🧬 Revolutionizing Liver Care

## 🩺 Liver Cirrhosis Prediction Web Application

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have **liver cirrhosis** based on clinical input parameters. It uses a **machine learning model trained on real healthcare data** to provide real-time predictions.
